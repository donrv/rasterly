\usage{
rplot(x, y = NULL, ...)

\method{rplot}{default}(x, y = NULL, ..., plot_width = 600,
  plot_height = 600, x_range = NULL, y_range = NULL,
  background = "white", reduction_func = NULL, layout = NULL,
  glyph = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Coordinates x, y for the plot.}

\item{...}{Other aesthetics to pass through, like \code{color}, \code{size} and \code{on}.}

\item{plot_width}{Integer. The width of the image to plot; must be a positive integer. A higher value indicates a higher resolution.}

\item{plot_height}{Integer. The height of the image to plot; must be a positive integer. A higher value indicates a higher resolution.}

\item{x_range}{Vector of type numeric. The range of \code{x}; it can be used to clip the image. For larger datasets, providing \code{x_range}
may result in improved performance.}

\item{y_range}{Vector of type numeric. The range of \code{y}; it can be used to clip the image. For larger datasets, providing \code{y_range}
may result in improved performance.}

\item{background}{Character. The background color of the image to plot.}

\item{reduction_func}{Function. A reduction function is used to aggregate data points into their pixel representations. Currently
supported reduction operators are \code{sum}, \code{any}, \code{mean}, \code{m2}, \code{first}, \code{last}, \code{min} and \code{max}. Default is \code{sum}. See details.}

\item{layout}{Character. The method used to generate layouts for multiple images. The default is \code{weighted}. Useful for categorical
data (i.e. "color" is provided via \code{aes()}). \code{weighted} specifies that the final raster should be a weighted combination of each
(categorical) aggregation matrix. Conversely, \code{cover} indicates that the afterwards objects will be drawn on top of 
the previous ones.}

\item{glyph}{Character. Currently, only "circle" and "square" are supported; as the \code{size} of the pixels increases, how should they
spread out -- should the pattern be circular or square? Other glyphs may be added in the future.}

\description{
\code{rplot} is created to generate \code{rasterly} plot quickly but with base 
\link{plot} design. It is convenient but lack of flexibility and \link{rasterly} is highly
recommended.
