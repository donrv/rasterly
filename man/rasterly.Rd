\usage{
rasterly(data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ..., plot_width = 600,
  plot_height = 600, x_range = NULL, y_range = NULL,
  background = "white", colour_map = c("lightblue", "darkblue"),
  colour_key = NULL, show_raster = TRUE, drop_data = FALSE,
  variable_check = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset to use for plot. If not provided, data must be supplied in each layer of the plot.
Since "rasterly" is used for large dataset, "\link[data.table]{data.table}" is recommended.}

\item{mapping}{Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot. The same with `ggplot2` \link[aes]{aes}.
See details.}

\item{...}{Other arguments can be passed to layers.}

\item{plot_width}{The width of image, must be positive integer. Higher value indicates higher resolution.}

\item{plot_height}{The height of image, must be positive integer. Higher value indicates higher resolution.}

\item{x_range}{The range of x; It can be used to clip the image. Also, to large dataset, provided `x_range`
can help to speed code}

\item{y_range}{The range of y; It can be used to clip the image. Also, to large dataset, provided `y_range`
can help to speed code}

\item{background}{Background colour of this image.}

\item{colour_map}{Colour used to map in each pixel. The `colour_map` would be extended by linear interpolation
independently for RGB. The darkness of the colour depends on the aggregation matrix value.}

\item{colour_key}{Used for categorical variable. In general, `colour_key` would be called when "colour"
is set in `aes()`}

\item{show_raster}{Logical value. Whether show raster or not.}

\item{drop_data}{Logical value. In general, data passed in has large size which may take too many rooms. When data is 
manipulated by given `aes()`, original data can be dropped via function `remove()` by setting `drop_data = TRUE`. 
See details for more information.}

\item{variable_check}{Logical value to drop unused columns. Setting `TRUE` can help to 
save more space by sacrificing speed.}
}
\value{
An environment wrapped by a list
}
\description{
Set initials for rasterly
}
\details{
\itemize{
 \item{}{In package "rasterly", only five aesthetics can be passed in `aes()` so far, "x", "y", "on", "colour" and "size".
variable "on" represents the reduction function works "on" which column.}
 \item{}{`drop_data` can help save space, especially to extremly large dataset, 
however, drop original data can cause layers fail to set new `aes()`.}
}
}
\note{
Call `rasterly()` alone does not generate anyting. `rasterize_...()` layers need to be attached.
