#' Easily and rapidly generate raster image data for large datasets using Plotly.js 
#' @description rasterly makes it easy to rapidly generate rasters in R, 
#' even for very large datasets, with an aesthetics-based mapping syntax that 
#' should be familiar to users of the \link{ggplot2} package. 
#' While rasterly does not attempt to reproduce the full functionality of the 
#' Datashader graphics pipeline system for Python, 
#' the rasterly API has several core elements in common with that software package.
#' 
#' A raster may be described as a matrix of cells or pixels arranged in grid-like 
#' fashion, in which each pixel represents a value in the source data.
#' 
#' When combined with the \link{plotly} package and Plotly.js, 
#' rasterly enables analysts to generate interactive figures with 
#' very large datasets which are responsive enough to embed into 
#' Dash for R applications.
#' 
#' @note Calling `rasterly()` without providing `rasterly_...()` layers has no effect.
